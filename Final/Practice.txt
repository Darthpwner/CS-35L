d. then and endfor are the only syntax errors

Answer: ad

There needs to be an "if" corresponding to "then", and "endfor" is not a valid
keyword.

Fixed code:
for i in "abc bcd cdf"; do
    echo "$i"
done

b - this will treat the whole thing as one string and i will be set to the 
whole string and be pritned only once.

Fixed code:
for i in abc bcd cdf; do
    echo "$i"
done

c- it will print abc bcd cdf in 3 lines because it sees it as 3 variables. It
treats it as 3 elements. It means we print these 3 elements in one line
