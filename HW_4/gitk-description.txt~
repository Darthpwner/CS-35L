The top left hand corner has a subwindow with all the patches listed in 
chronological order. As I scrolled down, I noticed that there were changes that
have been merged and descriptions of the changes that were made.

The subwindow in the middle of the top of the page shows the people who 
committed the changes and their emails. 

All the way to the top right is the date in the format 
YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND that the commit was made.

Shal ID showed the hash that was associated with the selected match.

The row shows the change number of the current branch and lower numbers reveal
more recent changes.

Search lets me look for a specific word or string of words and gives almost
immediate access in the ChangeLog.

The window underneath shows a diff version that compares the old and new 
versions of the file and I could switch between the pair using "C x o".
